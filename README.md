# Junk Drawers #

## About ##
Finished with a busy day of pillaging your local village or dungeon? Are you bags full and inventory bursting at the seams?!

Do you need to hastily unpack your whole inventory but your chests are always full? What about a Junk Drawer?

It has more than enough slots to stockpile your random resources... Just watch out, because like a real Junk Drawer, items have a tendency to get all tangled up.

Every time you open the drawer, the items move around. Not only that... you can only see the top two rows of the inventory at a time.
